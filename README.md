### Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to [@gurvirbaraich](https://github.com/gurvirbaraich), whose insightful suggestion led to the implementation of the "SAVE MEME" button in this project. Although I chose to add this feature by myself for practice purposes, his keen observation and proposed solution would have greatly improved the challenge's quality. Please take a look at his [solution](https://github.com/zun-liang/meme-generator/issues/1)!
